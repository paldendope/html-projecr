		Mineral water is also known as spring water because it comes from natural springs, which are places where moving underground water comes out of an opening in the land's surface. 

Mineral water can also be made artificially by adding salts to distilled water or aerating it with carbon dioxide to create more carbonation. However, mineral water is naturally carbonated to varying degrees. 

In one study, post-menopausal women drank 1 liter of mineral water per day for two periods of two months each. The results showed that mineral water intake lowered the levels of bad (LDL) cholesterol and raised the levels of good (HDL) cholesterol. 

Because high cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and other conditions, mineral water helps keep your heart healthy and working properly.

		In one 2004 study, researchers evaluated the effects of mineral water on subjects who all had borderline hypertension (high blood pressure) as well as low levels of calcium and magnesium. After four weeks of drinking mineral water, they noted a significant decrease in these peopleâ€™s blood pressure.
